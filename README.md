# Minimalist Zsh Theme for Oh My Zsh

Elevate your command-line experience with our Minimalist Zsh Theme designed exclusively for Oh My Zsh. This project aims to deliver a clean, elegant, and highly functional theme for your terminal, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing interaction with your shell environment.


## Installing and Setting up ZSH Theme
1. Clone the theme repository into a folder of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shukriYusof/minimalist-theme.git minimal
```
2. Navigate to the folder you just created:

```bash
cd /yourpath/minimal
```
3. Copy the `minimalist.zsh-theme` file into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory. You may need superuser privileges to do this, so use `sudo`:

```bash
sudo cp minimalist.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
```
## Enabling the Theme and Changing Settings

1. Open and edit your ZSH configuration file, usually named .zshrc. You can use your favorite text editor; here are two common options:
- Using VS Code:
```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```
- Using Vim:
```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

2. In your .zshrc file, locate the line that sets the ZSH theme. By default, it may look like this:

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

3. Change the default theme to the "amresh" theme by editing the line to:

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="minimalist"
```

   Your ZSH_THEME line should now look like this:
```zsh
ZSH_THEME="minimalist"
```

4. Save the changes to your `.zshrc` file.

5. Close and reopen your terminal to see the new theme in action. Your ZSH prompt should now be using the `"minimalist"` theme.

That's it! You've successfully installed and configured the "amresh" ZSH theme. Enjoy your new ZSH experience.
